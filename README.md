🌐 Sahayak: AI-Powered Smart Workflow & Productivity Platform  
Empowering Communities and Organizations through Automation, Transparency, and Data-Driven Intelligence.


🚀 Overview

Sahayak is an AI-powered smart digital platform designed to automate and optimize workflows such as event registrations, approvals, document validation, and task coordination across communities and organizations.

It streamlines operations by automating repetitive processes, predicting delays, and providing real-time visibility — enabling faster execution, better collaboration, and data-driven decision-making.

Built for the SnowStorm Hackathon powered by Tech4Hack.



🧩 Problem Statement

Communities, events, and organizations often rely on manual and fragmented systems for managing registrations, approvals, and internal workflows. These processes suffer from:

- Manual form processing and document verification  
- Lack of real-time status tracking  
- Inefficient task routing  
- No prediction of delays or bottlenecks  
- High dependency on human coordination  

These inefficiencies lead to poor productivity, low transparency, and a frustrating user experience.



💡 Proposed Solution

Sahayak introduces an AI-powered workflow automation layer that works on top of existing systems.

It automates document processing, intelligently routes tasks, predicts delays, and provides real-time dashboards — without replacing human decision-making.
